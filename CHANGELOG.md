## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Full web-first workflow:
  - New `/rolodex` dashboard for managing personal bookmarks
  - New `/` Yellowpages view for browsing admin-approved public entries
  - Entry submission system: users submit, admins approve for Yellowpages inclusion
- Role system:
  - Admin-only approval and editing of public entries via `/admin`
  - Admins manage Yellowpages entries via forks of user-submitted entries
- Forking logic for public entries:
  - Approved entries are cloned from user submissions
  - Public entries are marked with `is_public_copy=True`
  - Original user entry ID tracked in `original_id` for audit/history
- Tag-aware search:
  - Combined keyword + tag filtering
  - Tags now link to filtered views across index and dashboard
- Template and accessibility improvements:
  - Added ARIA attributes, `.sr-only`, and proper `:focus` state

### Changed
- Public index (`/`) now shows only admin-managed (approved) entries
- Distinct view styling:
  - `yellowpages.css` for public index
  - `rolodex.css` for personal dashboard
- Refactored project layout:
  - Separated views into `views/rolodex.py`, `views/directory.py`, `views/admin.py`
  - Moved business logic into `services/entries.py`, `services/users.py`
  - Created `utils/tags.py` for reusable tag parsing and cleaning
- Schema and ORM alignment:
  - Renamed `description` â†’ `notes`
  - Converted notes field to `Text`
  - Enforced `url` and `title` as non-null
- Security & access control:
  - Prevented editing of already-submitted entries
  - Wrapped commits in `try/except` with rollback safety
- Deprecated CLI mode:
  - Removed CLI references from UI and documentation
