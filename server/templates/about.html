  <h1>About Hyperindex</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>Hyperindex</strong> is a small project built around a simple idea: keep track of websites you like, and share the ones you think are worth revisiting.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The <strong>Yellow Pages</strong> is a shared collection made up of submissions from different users. Entries go through a quick admin review before they're visible to everyone. This keeps things lightweight and avoids spam or broken pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    For personal archiving, the site also features a <strong>Rolodex</strong>, where you save links, jot down notes, and tag things in a way that makes sense to you. None of this is public unless you choose to submit an entry.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's no feed, no algorithm, and no real pressure to “engage.” Hyperindex doesn't try to replace bookmarks or browsing — it's more like a public notepad for the web. If you remember old directories, zine-style link pages, or early blogs with a sidebar full of links — that's the vibe.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's intentionally plain. The goal is to keep it usable and human without much overhead.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project is open-source and designed for longevity, transparency, and fun. Whether you're into digital gardening, link rot prevention, or just miss the old internet, Hyperindex is a place to build your own slice of it.
